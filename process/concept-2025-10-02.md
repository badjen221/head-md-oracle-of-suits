## Research
My research is based on the Mamluk cards, considered the “mother” of tarot and European playing cards. The goal was to understand their content, structure, and symbolism.

- The four suits: Polo-sticks, Multitudes (Cups), Scimitars (Swords), Coins.

- Court system: Inscribed names (King, Deputy, Second Deputy, Third Deputy) instead of human figures.

- Ornament & design: Geometric, floral, and calligraphic decoration.

- Arabic inscriptions: Some cards include poetry or titles that give cultural meaning.

- Historical importance: These cards influenced the development of European decks.
